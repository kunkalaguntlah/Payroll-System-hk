# Payroll-System-hk
Java OOP-based project that manages an array of up to 50 employees, offering features for adding employees, searching by last name, displaying employees by number, and running payroll. The program includes a menu-driven interface with options to create employees (Hourly, Salaried, or Commissioned), validate user input, and store employee details. Employees can be searched by last name using quicksort and sequential search or displayed by employee number using quicksort and binary search. The payroll feature collects data for hourly and commissioned employees, calculates paychecks, sorts employees by paycheck amount using selection sort, and generates a formatted payroll report. The program avoids using Javaâ€™s built-in sorting and searching methods, instead implementing custom algorithms for all operations.
